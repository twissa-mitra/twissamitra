# Twissa Mitra GitHub Portfolio

Welcome! This is where I share projects in systems and computational biology.  
Areas of focus:
- Bioinformatics workflows (RNA-seq, motif discovery, multivariate statistics)  
- Systems modeling (ODEs, flux balance analysis, stochastic modeling)  
- Programming in Python, R, MATLAB  

Projects coming soon:
- RNA-seq Pipeline Demo  
- Motif Discovery & Entropy Scoring  
- Flux Balance Analysis with COBRApy  
- ML Classifier for RNA-seq Data
