# Twissa Mitra GitHub Portfolio

Welcome! This is where I share projects in systems and computational biology.  
Areas of focus:
- Bioinformatics workflows (RNA-seq, motif discovery, multivariate statistics)  
- Systems modeling (ODEs, flux balance analysis, stochastic modeling)  
- Programming in Python, R, MATLAB  

Projects completed:
- RNA-seq Pipeline Demo  
A reproducible RNA-seq workflow using public data.  
QC (FastQC), alignment (STAR/HISAT2), quantification (featureCounts), and DE analysis (DESeq2) with R/Python utilities.

- Motif Discovery & Entropy Scoring  
Python + Jupyter workflow to compute and visualize motif entropy and compare sequence variants.
